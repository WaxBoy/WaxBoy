## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Sean McBee,
and I want to transition into Customer-oriented Tech Sales. By actively listening, I can easily interpret customers' needs and ensure their satisfaction. Following my education and passions, I am specifically interested in tech sales (SaaS, phones, etc.)

#### Alternatively,
I am heavily interested in being a Systems Administrator.

### Now,
I am working on the sales floor at target, assisting guests and ensuring zone organization.

### Previously,
I worked at a kid's bungee jump and animal cars attraction for almost 2 years. I made sure that kids felt comfortable and had fun, to ensure that parent's would continue to bring their children. I would also perform occasional maintenance on the equipment as it was necessary, to ensure safety and operation efficiency.
